Implement a **Naive Bayes classifier** to detect positive and negative sentiment from reviews. 

**Dataset** : *Sentiment Labelled Sentences*

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences

This dataset contains sentences labelled with positive or negative sentiment, extracted from reviews of products, movies, and restaurants. The sentences come from three different websites: imdb.com, amazon.com, and
yelp.com. For each website, there exist 500 positive and 500 negative sentences.

• Consider the first 80% of the data in each website review for train and the rest 20% of each website review for test.

• Use each word as a feature and construct a dictionary. (for each website review separately. So, we have 3 dictionaries)
